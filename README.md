Theme: Size and Fitting

To help customers know how a particular dress/outfit would look on them, we have come up with a Virtual Try-on with Clothes model. 
Customers would be asked to upload their photo. Our model would process this uploaded photo with the customer's selected outfit & size to generate a photo of the customer in the outfit they wish to buy!
This would help the customer choose their size and get an idea about the fitting of the outfit on them. 
This would reduce the number of returns to a great extent besides enhancing the customer's shopping experience!
